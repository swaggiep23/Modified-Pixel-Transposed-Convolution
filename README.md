# Modified-pixel-deconvolution

This repository implements neural networks based on pixel-transposed convolution and its variations, for comparisons using Tensorflow 2. Pixel-transposed convolution is defined in [link to the paper yet to be added]
Datasets that were used for evaluation were: Pascal VOC2012 (lacked hardware resources to train for a larger number of epochs) and the Oxford-IIIT pets dataset.

Any other datasets required can be used using the config.py file
The directory structure for the project is contained in directory_struct.txt
