However, suppose you want to know the shape of that object, which pixel belongs to which object, etc. In this case, you need to assign a class to each pixel of the image—this task is known as segmentation. A segmentation model returns much more detailed information about the image. Image segmentation has many applications in medical imaging, self-driving cars and satellite imaging, just to name a few.\n",

The dataset consists of images of 37 pet breeds, with 200 images per breed (~100 each in the training and test splits). Each image includes the corresponding labels, and pixel-wise masks. The masks are class-labels for each pixel. Each pixel is given one of three categories:\n",
